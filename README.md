# Instructions
- Fork the repo to your git account
- clone the forked repo
- add your own html file and work on it
- apply what you learned about git and github (updating changes, committing adding files and stuff)

All necessary icons (images are under images folder), to use an image just say
 <object data="images/home.svg" width="20" type=""></object>
 home.svg can be replaced by any image that's available
